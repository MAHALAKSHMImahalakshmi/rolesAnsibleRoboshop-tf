# Note on Using Double Quotes with Ansible Variables
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Use double quotes in YAML when you need to:
#    - Concatenate variables with strings (e.g., in URLs or file paths)
#    - Avoid YAML parsing errors with special characters
#    - Example: url: "https://example.com/{{ component }}-v3.zip"
#
# 2. Do NOT put extra quotes inside the variable itself:
#    - Wrong: url: https://example.com/"{{ component }}"-v3.zip
#    - Right:  url: "https://example.com/{{ component }}-v3.zip"
#
# 3. In playbooks (like main.yaml), quotes are often needed around variables in keys like hosts or roles:
#    - hosts: "{{ component }}"
#    - roles:
#        - "{{ component }}"
#    - This prevents YAML parsing issues when the variable is at the start of a line or is the only value.
#
# 4. In tasks (like appsetup.yaml), use quotes only when needed for string concatenation or special characters:
#    - dest: "/tmp/{{ component }}.zip"
#    - url: "https://roboshop-artifacts.s3.amazonaws.com/{{ component }}-v3.zip"
#    - Do NOT use: dest: /tmp/"{{ component }}".zip
#
# 5. If you add extra quotes inside the variable, the resulting string will be invalid and may cause errors (like HTTP 403 or file not found).
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Summary: Use quotes around the whole string if needed, but never around the variable itself inside the string.
